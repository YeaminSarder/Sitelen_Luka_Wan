Write Toki Pona words using only 6 symbols


This is inspired by [Linja pi kute mute](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/diihq7/linja_pi_kute_mute_write_toki_pona_with_six/&ved=2ahUKEwjT0LfZj-SCAxXh2TgGHaLbBB4Qjjh6BAgHEAE&usg=AOvVaw2uB_jS9OuOoQsEQ69LCMEb)

It says you can write the 120 pu words using only 6 characters. It groups some of the characters and uses a single character in place of them.

I wanted to include 17 ku suli words and also be selective of
such possible groupings of characters. So, I compiled an *exhaustive* list of such
groupings. You are welcome to discuss about which one is the best for what reasons.

The list can be found [here](toki_pona_in_6_char_grps.txt)

- Each line is an array and represents a valid grouping.
- there are 6 subarrays in the array.
- if you replace each characters in the subarray with a symbol,
  it is still possible to identify each words uniquely.
