Write Toki Pona words using only 6 symbols

This is inspired by Linja pi kute mute.
It says you can write the 120 pu words using only 6 characters.
Now, I wanted to include 17 ku suli words and also be selective of
the such possible groupings. So, I compiled an exhaustive list of such
groupings. You are welcome to discuss about which one is the best for what reasons.

The list can be found [here]
