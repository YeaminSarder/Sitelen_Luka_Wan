Write Toki Pona words using only 6 symbols

This is inspired by [Linja pi kute mute](https://www.reddit.com?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2).
It says you can write the 120 pu words using only 6 characters.
Now, I wanted to include 17 ku suli words and also be selective of
the such possible groupings. So, I compiled an exhaustive list of such
groupings. You are welcome to discuss about which one is the best for what reasons.

The list can be found [here](toki_pona_in_6_char_grps.txt)

- Each line is an array and represents a valid grouping.
- there are 6 subarrays in the array.
- if you replace each characters in the subarray with a symbol,
  it is still possible to identify each words uniquely.
